Building C
==========

# Building features

Building C is a two-story building with a total area of **900 square meters (30 x 30 meters)**. The ground floor (Floor 0) features an **underfloor cable raceway that is connected to an external ditch**, while the first floor (Floor 1) has a **dropped ceiling that is 2.5 meters from the ground**, providing approximately 0.5 meters of space that can be used to install cable raceways and wireless access points. The ceiling height of Floor 0 is **4 meters**, and the effective ceiling height of Floor 1 is **2.5 meters**.

The building has two storage areas: **Room C.0.14 and Room C.1.8**. Both rooms can be used to house cross-connects for the structured cabling system. In addition, Room C.1.8 can also store other network infrastructure hardware.

# Network outlets per room

Structured cabling standards specifies a minimum of **two outlets per work area**, and also a ratio of **two outlets for each 10 square meters of area**. That ratio will be maintained throughout the project.

### Outlets and Measurements

There are a few business rules to point out regarding the **outlet placement**:

* Room C.0.14 is a storage area that may be used to house a cross-connect, no network outlets are required there, and the same applies to restrooms, halls, and corridors.

* Rooms C.0.1, C.0.2, and C.0.3 have specific purposes and the only network outlets necessary are two near each floor cable passageway

| Access Point  | --------- | ---------  | -------  | 2           |

Note that all measurements were taken on paper using a scale of 2.5 centimeters to represent 5 meters in real life.

**Total outlets: 86 (corresponds to 43 double outlets)**

### Access Points

Given the floor's dimensions of **30 x 30 meters**, an access point with a radius of coverage of approximately 25 meters is deemed adequate for the space. Therefore, a single access point is expected to provide sufficient coverage for the entirety of the floor. Two cables go from the ground to the wall and then to the ceiling, then they connect to a double outlet that has the purpose of serving the AP.

The following image will depict the coverage radius of the access point in question:

### Outlets

Similarly to Floor 0, there are a few business rules to point out regarding outlet placement:

* Room C.1.8 is a storage area that may be used to house network infrastructure hardware, so the number of network outlets is variable and depends on the hardware to be installed. For the first sprint, no outlets will be installed yet.
  
* Restrooms, halls, and corridors do not require network outlets.

**Total outlets: 84 (with 1 extra double outlet for the Access Point)**

### Access Points

Floor 1 also has dimensions of **30 x 30 meters** and a single access point is expected to provide sufficient coverage for the floor. The access point's radius of coverage should be approximately 25 meters, similar to the one on Floor 0.
