# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #
In this section, all technical decisions taken in the planning meeting should be mentioned. 		Most importantly, all technical decisions impacting on the subtasks implementation must be settled on this 		meeting and specified here.

#### Examples: ####
  * Backbone cable types to be used
  * VLAN IDs to be used
  * VTP domains
  * WiFi channels
  * IPv4 networks' addresses and routers' addresses
  * Routing protocols, AS identifiers and area identifiers
  * Application protocols outlining (further coordination may be required between members)
