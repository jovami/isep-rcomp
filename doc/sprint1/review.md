# 2. Subtasks assessment #

One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

* Totally implemented with no issues
* Totally implemented with issues
* Partially implemented with no issues
* Partially implemented with issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
